# Data-Projects
#### 1. Investigating Netflix Movies and Guest Stars in The Office
In this project, I will apply the skills that I have learned in Introduction to Python and Intermediate Python to solve a real-world data science problem. This will allow to perform critical tasks such as manipulating raw data and drawing conclusions from plots that create of the data. 
#### 2.Disney Movies and Box Office Success
Since the 1930s, Walt Disney Studios has released more than 600 films covering a wide range of genres. While some movies are indeed directed towards kids, many are intended for a broad audience. In this project, I will analyze data to see how Disney movies have changed in popularity since its first movie release. I will also perform hypothesis testing to see what aspects of a movie contribute to its success.
This project assumes that we can manipulate data using pandas and can make basic plots using Seaborn and be familiar with statistical inference and be able to perform two-sample bootstrap hypothesis tests for difference of means.
#### 3. Customer Segmentation
The most successful companies today are the ones that know their customers so well that they can anticipate their needs. Data analysts play a key role in unlocking these in-depth insights, and segmenting the customers to better serve them. In this project, I will apply real-world techniques on customer segmentation and behavioral analytics, using a real dataset containing anonymized customer transactions from an online retailer. I will make  the segments more powerful with k-means clustering.
